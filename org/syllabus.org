* Objectives

This course on *CS 101 – Introduction to Programming II* is the second
semester of the introductory programming sequence and builds directly
on CS 100. While CS 100 introduces programming fundamentals and
computational problem-solving techniques using a high-level language,
this course shifts the emphasis from *control* to *data*.

Students learn how programs organize, manage, and reason about data
using abstraction. Core topics include abstract data types (ADTs),
fundamental data structures, encapsulation, and informal reasoning
about performance. The course emphasizes conceptual understanding,
practical use of library components, and disciplined program design,
preparing students for later study in data structures, algorithms, and
systems.

* Target audience

This course is intended for students who have completed CS 100 or an
equivalent introductory programming course. It is appropriate both for
students continuing in computer science or related fields and for
students with prior programming experience who are ready to engage
with data-centric problem solving and abstraction.

Students with substantial prior programming background may enter this
course directly with departmental approval.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Apply computational problem-solving techniques to data-oriented
  problems.
- Explain and use abstract data types (ADTs) to structure programs.
- Use and reason about classic data structures such as arrays, lists,
  stacks, queues, and associative containers.
- Describe and apply recursion in problem solving.
- Use introductory tree-based structures at a conceptual level.
- Organize programs using encapsulation and basic object-oriented
  principles.
- Compare alternative solutions using informal notions of complexity
  and performance trade-offs.
- Describe classic searching and sorting algorithms at a conceptual
  level.
- Read, adapt, and reuse library components and existing code.
- Enter a formal data structures course with greater programming
  maturity and conceptual clarity.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: CS 100 – Introduction to Programming, or
equivalent experience with departmental approval.

Students are expected to be comfortable with basic programming
concepts, including variables, control structures (loops and
conditionals), functions or methods, and simple input/output.  No
prior exposure to formal data structures or algorithm analysis is
assumed. Success in this course requires regular practice, careful
reasoning about data and abstraction, and incremental program
development.

* Weekly schedule

The course meets *once per week* on *Fridays, 5:00–8:00 PM (Pacific
Standard Time)* for *16 weeks*, beginning *January 30*. This schedule
reflects actual course delivery, with a narrower and more realistic
scope emphasizing foundational data structures, STL usage, and program
organization.

* Grading system

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN   | DESCRIPTION              | IMPACT |
|--------+--------------------------+--------|
| Weekly | Programming assignments  |    25% |
| Weekly | Participation & Practice |    25% |
| Weekly | Multiple choice tests    |    25% |
| TBD    | Final exam (optional)    |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and

- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions. *Note:* You
  only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your grade
  at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below your
  final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter grades. for
the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs, while for the
term results, only straight letters are given (by rounding up). This
table is also used in Canvas to compute your grades. Transitions
between letter grades are rounded (e.g. 89.5% to 90%).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE*    |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 59.5% to 0%    | F (FAILED)       |

* A note on using AI to write code for you or debug your code

[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/fall25/UsingAItoCode.org][See full PDF on GitHub (Fall 2025 update).]]

Summary:

1. Only use AI if you don't (deeply) care about the result, if you
   don't depend on it, and if you have ample time to waste.

2. AI lies unpredictably, and worse, it makes you forget stuff you
   already knew. It's an unreliable helper without understanding.

3. There is little solid research into the human-AI interaction and
   its benefits and dangers - because of the pace of development but
   also because of the reigning commercial interests.

4. The value of AI increases somewhat when you use it for topics and
   on issues that you are already an expert in. Then you can
   second-guess and monitor the results much better. It still boils
   down to a waste of time whenever the issues are complex.

I got to these insights through my own experience as a teacher of
computer and data science, as someone who hears a lot from other
faculty what they're experiencing, and as a coder.
