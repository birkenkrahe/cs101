* Course Description

This course teaches beginners how to use modern AI systems as *agents*
capable of planning, acting, automating, and collaborating. Students
learn to transform their own real-world workflows into agentic
automations through structured conversation, without requiring prior
programming experience.

The course ends with a practical capstone project that automates a
genuine workflow drawn from a student’s work or academic environment.

* Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to:
1. Describe a workflow clearly using natural language.
2. Collaborate with an AI agent to break workflows into steps.
3. Use conversational prompting to create simple automations or scripts.
4. Build repeatable agentic workflows with verification and guardrails.
5. Recognize limitations and failure modes of agentic tools.
6. Deliver a functional workflow automation in a capstone project.

* Prerequisites

None. This may sound weird for a 400-level course. What it means is
that you can come to this course with any previous knowledge (or lack
thereof) and learn something useful, as long as you're curious and not
resilient to learning, or hostile to AI or computers in general.

* Required Materials

- A laptop (any OS), though browser access will suffice for viewering,
  you may need to install apps locally on your PC.
- Access to modern AI tools (ChatGPT or similar) - a free subscription
  to ChatGPT Team will be provided for the duration of the course.

* Course Tools

The course uses conversational AI systems (primarily ChatGPT) as the
agent runtime, with plain-text files (TXT, CSV, PDF) serving as state,
memory, and verification artifacts. Agent workflows are visualized
using Mermaid, a free text-based diagram language rendered with tools
such as Obsidian, VS Code, or a web browser, emphasizing transferable
reasoning skills rather than platform-specific automation tools.

* Grading System

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION             | IMPACT |
|---------+-------------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Programming Assignments |    25% |
| Weekly  | Multiple choice tests   |    25% |
| Monthly | Project sprint reviews  |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional)   |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and
  practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions in the form
  of an oral exam. *Note:* You only have to attempt the final exam if
  you want to improve your grade at the end of the course. If the
  final exam result is below your final grade average up to this
  point, it will be ignored.

* Meeting Structure (75 minutes)

Typical session plan:
- *Mini-lecture* (15–20 minutes): concept, demonstration, context
- *Hands-on workshop* (45–50 minutes): guided agentic workflow building
- *Reflection + verification* (5–10 minutes): checking reliability,
  summarizing lessons
