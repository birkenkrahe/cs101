* Objectives

This course on *CS 101 – Introduction to Programming II* is the second
semester of the introductory programming sequence and builds directly
on CS 100. While CS 100 introduces programming fundamentals and
computational problem-solving techniques using a high-level language,
this course shifts the emphasis from *control* to *data*.

Students learn how programs organize, manage, and reason about data
using abstraction. Core topics include abstract data types (ADTs),
fundamental data structures, encapsulation, and informal reasoning
about performance. The course emphasizes conceptual understanding,
practical use of library components, and disciplined program design,
preparing students for later study in data structures, algorithms, and
systems.

* Target audience

This course is intended for students who have completed CS 100 or an
equivalent introductory programming course. It is appropriate both for
students continuing in computer science or related fields and for
students with prior programming experience who are ready to engage
with data-centric problem solving and abstraction.

Students with substantial prior programming background may enter this
course directly with departmental approval.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete this course will be able to:
- Apply computational problem-solving techniques to data-oriented
  problems.
- Explain and use abstract data types (ADTs) to structure programs.
- Use and reason about classic data structures such as arrays, lists,
  stacks, queues, and associative containers.
- Describe and apply recursion in problem solving.
- Use introductory tree-based structures at a conceptual level.
- Organize programs using encapsulation and basic object-oriented
  principles.
- Compare alternative solutions using informal notions of complexity
  and performance trade-offs.
- Describe classic searching and sorting algorithms at a conceptual
  level.
- Read, adapt, and reuse library components and existing code.
- Enter a formal data structures course with greater programming
  maturity and conceptual clarity.

* Course requirements

Formal prerequisites: CS 100 – Introduction to Programming, or
equivalent experience with departmental approval.

Students are expected to be comfortable with basic programming
concepts, including variables, control structures (loops and
conditionals), functions or methods, and simple input/output.  No
prior exposure to formal data structures or algorithm analysis is
assumed. Success in this course requires regular practice, careful
reasoning about data and abstraction, and incremental program
development.

* Weekly schedule

The course meets *once per week* on *Fridays, 5:00–8:00 PM (Pacific
Standard Time)* for *16 weeks*, beginning *January 30*. This schedule
reflects actual course delivery, with a narrower and more realistic
scope emphasizing foundational data structures, STL usage, and program
organization.
